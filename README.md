# welcome to my github

## about me
hello! i am a first year computer science student at case western reserve university.  i have around ten repositories, but the ones listed below are my favorites.  

## my favorite repositories

- ### [matricie](https://github.com/rachel-tj/matricie)
  several linear algebra functions that help with matricies, such as taking the inverse of an nxn matrix or using rref.  there's also a truth table generator where you input a statement such as "(p^q) -> r" and it will print the truth table with p, q, r, and the aforementioned statement. 
- ### [qube](https://github.com/rachel-tj/qube)
  an algorigthm that can solve a rubik's cube using dijikstra's algorithm, while printing the instructions.  the average runtime is around 0.4 seconds.  
- ### [python madness](https://github.com/deadfishh/python-madness)
  in order to learn python, i redid the data structures assignments in python (linked list, stack, queue, hashtable graph), and wrote a base converter that can go anywhere between base 2 and 36.  
- ### [senior projects](https://github.com/rachel-tj/senior-projects)
  my end-of-the-year projects for linear algebra and ap literature, respectively.  in linear algebra, i made a low-level chatbot using text files and markov chains.  in ap lit, i made a personality test that told the user which character from the year they were most similar to.  
- ### [stem](https://github.com/rachel-tj/stem)
  my personal website/blog.  definetly one of my favorite things on here.  
- ### [data structures](https://github.com/rachel-tj/data-structures)
  everything from cwru data structures, also known as csds 233.  the files here are all written in java, but there's also python translations in the python  madness folder.
